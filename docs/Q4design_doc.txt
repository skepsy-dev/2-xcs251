# TODO: Write a short (1-3 paragraph) design document about your solution to Q4.
#       Please include the following:
#     
#         1) An explanation of what you wrote and how the ScriptPubKey works
#         2) Briefly, how the ScriptPubKey you wrote fits into the bigger 
#            picture of this atomic swap.
#         3) Consider the case of Alice sending coins to Bob with coinExchangeScript:
#            Why can Alice always get her money back if Bob doesn't redeem it? 
#            Why can't this be solved with a simple 1-of-2 multisig? 
#


The scripPubKey is set up to validate the secret key submitted along with the recipients 
public key via signature. If the secret and signture both match as expected the transaction 
will execute to the recipient. The embedded if statement allows the sender to redeem the 
transaction after the specified Locktime has been dropped/passed, incase the recipient 
does not claim it or go through with the swap. This allows Alice to always get her money 
back if Bob doesn't redeem it. A straight 1-of-2 multisig would be unsecure becuase Alice 
could collect back the funds before Bob could redeem them and or Bob could redeem the funds 
before Alice has reveled the secret/redeemed her side of the transaction prior, as the deal 
was intedned.
